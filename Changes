Release 1.16.1:
- Make the tests faster and more robust
- Update dependencies and documentation.

Release 1.16:
- Use dune as the build system (contributed by Andrey Mokhov, PR #24)
- Add BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s hash and MAC functions.

Release 1.15:
- Added constant-time `string_equal` and `bytes_equal` comparison functions
  (execution time depends on the lengths of the strings but not on their
  contents) (issue #13, PR #14)
- Caml FFI: use caml_ long names and CAML_NAME_SPACE; get rid of Begin_roots
- OASIS files regenerated in dynamic mode for OCaml 4.09 compatibility.
  For this reason, OASIS is now a build dependency.

Release 1.14:
- Ensure compatibility with OCaml 4.09 and up.
- Detect early AMD Ryzen 3000 bug where the RDRAND instruction always
  generates 0xFF...FF, and, in this case, report the hardware RNG as
  unavailable.
- Fix formatting of documentation comments (issue #3, PR #5)
- Optional argument to control whether the zlib transform expects a
  zlib header (PR #12).
- Fix issue with zlib >= 1.2.9 where internal sanity check is affected
  by the stream data block being moved by OCaml's GC (issue #7, PR #17).
- DH.new_parameters: update documentation to suggest at least 2048
  bits (PR #18).
- DH.derive_key: use SHA256 instead of SHA1 (PR #19).

Release 1.13:
- Add the Chacha20 stream cipher.
- Add the AES-CMAC (a.k.a. AES-OMAC1) message authentication code.
- Pseudo-random number generator: replace the old AES-CBC-Fibonacci generator
  with a faster, simpler generator based on Chacha20.
- Add an alternate pseudo-random number generator based on AES in CTR mode.
- Documentation: warn about known cryptographic weaknesses in Triple DES,
  Blowfish, and ARCfour.
- Documentation: warn about problems with variable-length messages in
  MACs based on block ciphers in CBC mode.

Release 1.12:
- Fix x86-32 compilation error and improve detection of AES-NI for x86
  processors (Jeremie Dimino, Etienne Millon)
  (Closes: #1646)
- AES-NI: align key_schedule on a 16 byte boundary (Etienne Millon)
  (Closes: #1709)
- Add original Keccak submission to SHA-3 (Yoichi Hirai)

Release 1.11:
- Adapt to "safe string" mode (OCaml 4.02 and later required).
  The API should remain backward-compatible for clients compiled
  in "unsafe string" mode.  
- Update SHA-3 to the official NIST standard (different padding than
  in the Keccak submission).  (Closes: #1528)
- Fixed bounds checking in "add_substring" methods of hash functions
  and other functions that operate on a substring of a string.
  (Closes: #1480)
- Use hardware implementation of AES when available on x86 processors.
  (Faster than the software implementation and less sensitive to
   side channel attacks.)
- Use the Zarith library to implement RSA.
  (Faster than the previous implementation and less sensitive to
   side channel attacks.)
- Support the hardware random number generator present in recent
  x86 processors.
- Rebuilt generated files with Oasis 0.4.6 for OCaml 4.03 compatibility.

Release 1.10:
- Add all SHA-2 hash functions: SHA-224, SHA-384 and SHA-512 
  in addition to the existing SHA-256.  (Closes: #1223)
- Add support for CTR (Counter) chaining mode.
- Fix compilation error with OCaml 4.03+dev.
- Avoid using some obsolete OCaml stdlib functions.

Release 1.9:
 - More fixes to build in Windows with zlib (mingw and msvc).

Release 1.8:
 - Build .cmxs with C bindings (Closes: #1303)
 - Use advapi32 on Windows (Close: #1055)
 - Allow to define --zlib-include and --zlib-libdir if zlib is not installed in
   the standard location.

Release 1.7:
- Added SHA-3 hash function.

Release 1.6:
- Regenerate setup.ml with oasis 0.3.0~rc6 version

Release 1.5:
- Fix bug check in buffered_output#ensure_capacity (Closes: #879)
- Allow to have padding in Base64 (Closes: #897)

Release 1.4:
- Added Blowfish block cipher.
- Added MAC functions based on HMAC construction applied to 
  SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160.
- Added OASIS and findlib support (Closes: #589)

Release 1.3:
- Added hash functions SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160.
- Added "flush" method to transforms.
- Fixed infinite loop in decompression of incorrect data.

Release 1.2:
- MS Windows port

Release 1.1:
- Added Diffie-Hellman key agreement
- Exported raw modular arithmetic operations (mod_power, mod_mult)

Release 1.0:
- First public release
